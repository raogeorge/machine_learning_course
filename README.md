This is a machine learning library developed by George Rao for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah.

For HW2, two folders "Ensemble Learning" and "Linear Regression" in the same level as the folder "Decision Tree" are created. Pythons files are located under each folder. To run the python code, please use the run file in each respect folder.

For HW3, use the run file in the "Perceptron" folder.

For HW4, use the run file in the "SVM" folder to get the result for Q1(a-c) and Q2(a-d)

For HW5, use the run file in the "Neural Networks" folder to get the result for Q1(a-c, e)
